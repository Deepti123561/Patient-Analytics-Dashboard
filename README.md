This healthcare waitlist dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of patient wait times and trends across various medical specialties, case types, and patient demographics. The dashboard is intended to help healthcare administrators and managers analyze waitlist data effectively, allowing them to identify bottlenecks, allocate resources more efficiently, and improve patient care.

Here’s an in-depth look at how each component of this dashboard works and what insights it offers:

1. Summary and Waitlist Comparison
The Total Wait List Comparison section provides an at-a-glance view of the latest monthly waitlist count compared to the previous year. This helps users understand if the backlog has increased or decreased over time.
For example, with 709K patients in the latest month compared to 640K the previous year, there’s a noticeable increase, signaling a potential rise in demand or bottlenecks in the healthcare system.
2. Waitlist Analysis by Age Profile and Time Band
This visual component breaks down the average waitlist across different age groups (0-15, 16-64, 65+) and time bands (e.g., 0-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-9 months, etc.).
Each age group is represented by a different color, making it easy to see which demographic is waiting the longest.
This analysis allows administrators to pinpoint age groups that are experiencing longer wait times and take targeted actions. For instance, if older adults (65+) are waiting disproportionately longer, the organization might consider prioritizing resources for geriatric care.
3. Case Type Distribution
The Overall Case Type Distribution is shown through a pie chart that displays the percentage of cases categorized as Outpatient, Day Case, and Inpatient.
Outpatients constitute the largest share (72%), followed by Day Case (17%) and Inpatient (11%).
Understanding this distribution is crucial for resource planning, as Outpatient cases may require different types of resources and facilities compared to Inpatient cases.
4. Top 5 Specialties with the Longest Wait Times
This section lists the top five specialties with the highest average wait times, such as Pediatric Dermatology and Pediatric ENT, which have average wait times exceeding 100 days.
Knowing which specialties have the longest wait times can help healthcare managers prioritize staffing and resources for these areas, ultimately improving patient satisfaction and reducing delays.
5. Monthly Trend Analysis by Case Type
This line chart shows the monthly trend of patient waitlists for different case types (Outpatient, Day Case, Inpatient) from 2018 to 2021.
The Outpatient waitlist shows a generally upward trend, while Day Case and Inpatient trends appear more stable or slightly decreasing.
Analyzing these trends over time helps administrators spot seasonal patterns, sudden Detailed Grid View
The Detailed Grid View is a table providing a breakdown of waitlist numbers by specialty, age group, and time band, with columns for Day Case, Inpatient, Outpatient, and Total counts.
This detailed, drill-down view allows users to analyze waitlists at a granular level. For example, it shows specific numbers for specialties like Pediatric Radiology or Small Volume Specialties by each age group (e.g., 0-15, 16-64).
Such granular data is essential for specialty-specific planning, as it helps pinpoint areas where delays are concentrated, whether by age group, specialty, or case type.
7. Specialty Group Breakdown
A horizontal bar chart ranks specialties based on their total waitlist count, with specialties like Bones, General, ENT, and Eyes showing the highest patient demand.
This view helps administrators quickly identify the most in-demand specialties, which could benefit from increased resources or dedicated staff to reduce wait times.
8. Filter Options
The dashboard offers interactive filters for Archive Date, Case Type, Specialty Name, Age Profile, and Time Bands.
These filters make it easy for users to customize their view, focusing on specific time periods, specialties, patient demographics, or case types.
For example, a user can filter to view only Inpatient data for a specific specialty over a defined date range, helping narrow down insights to relevant details.
Key Insights and Benefits:
Demand Visualization: By displaying total and specialty-specific waitlists, the dashboard highlights high-demand areas that may require more resources.
Age and Time Band Analysis: The age-specific and time band breakdown offers actionable insights into which demographics need faster processing to reduce prolonged wait times.
Resource Allocation: The dashboard informs healthcare administrators about which specialties have the longest wait times and the highest demand, aiding resource allocation and planning.
Trend Monitoring: With monthly trend analysis, the dashboard allows for tracking demand changes over time, helping administrators adjust operations proactively.
Customizable Insights: The detailed grid view and filters allow for in-depth exploration of the data, enabling data-driven decision-making at both a macro and micro level.
Overall, this healthcare waitlist dashboard is a powerful tool for improving operational efficiency, patient satisfaction, and resource management within healthcare facilities by providing a comprehensive overview of patient wait times across multiple dimensions.






spikes, or drops in demand, enabling them to make proactive adjustments. For example, if Outpatient demand is steadily increasing, it may be necessary to expand outpatient services.
